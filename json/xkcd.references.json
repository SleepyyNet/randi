His love of bakeries is a recurring gag in the comic.\nPanel 4 I love the blogosphere!\nA reference to comic 239: Blagofaire, where someone from the far future believes many people blogged from high-altitude balloons whilst wearing red capes and goggles. The flying character may be Cory Doctorow, who is mentioned in the comic as the only blogger to actually do this, and who also appeared in comic 345: 1337: Part 5 in this guise.\nPanel 5 I love the whole world. (Cueball running in large hamster ball.)\nLikely a reference to comic 152: Hamster Ball, though there are multiple comics featuring human-sized hamster balls.\nPanel 6 And all its messed-up folks.\nA reference to the /b/ (\"Random\") forum on 4chan, which is in fact home to plenty of \"messed-up folks\". This on-line behavior is something Randall comments on in several comics both before and after this. For instance in 202: YouTube.\nPanel 7 Boom de yada, Boom de yada (Cueball and Megan immersed in playpen balls.)\nA reference to comic 150: Grownups, where Megan decides that she has the ability to, and wants to, turn her house into a giant ball pit.\nPanel 8 Boom de yada, Boom de yada (I put on my robe and wizard hat)\nA reference to this roleplay chat transcript (NSFW), which became an Internet meme. A user named bloodninja would roleplay as a wizard during cybersex (saying \"I put on my robe and wizard hat\" to signal this) and invariably infuriate his unwitting partners with demeaning actions. Other incidents involved him roleplaying as a rhinoceros. In the above mentioned comic 150: Grownups the two characters also disappear, but in that case a big pink heart comes out of the playpen balls.\nPanel 9 I love your suffering.\nThe recurring character Black Hat is being his usual self and causing suffering for his own amusement, as in comic 72: Classhole. In this panel he is seen either taking a present away from a child, who is upset, or giving the child a package containing a bobcat, like the package in comic 325: A-Minus-Minus. This last possibility would explain the lines indicating the box to be moving in Black Hat's hands.\nPanel 10 I love cryptography.\nCryptography is a subject that comes up often in the comic, notably, in comics 153: Cryptography and 177: Alice and Bob before this one (for a full list see Category:Cryptography). The panel shows a flowchart of the kind commonly used to show how a particular cryptosystem works and/or how it can be broken.\nPanel 11 I love entangled sheets.\nSexual reference. Sex and red sheets are also brought up in comic 230: Hamiltonian.\nPanel 12 And kite photography.\nA reference to Randall's own hobby of kite photography as well as comic 235: Kite.\nPanel 13 I love the whole world (Map of the internet.)\nA reference to comic 256: Online Communities, featuring online communities of the time visualised as a world map, with geographic area representing their approximate membership size. There is, more directly, a pun on \"internet\", namely \"outernet\".\nPanel 14 And all its mysteries.\nA reference to a series of comics on \"red spiders:\" 8: Red Spiders, 43: Red Spiders 2, 47: Counter-Red Spiders, 126: Red Spiders Cometh, and 427: Bad Timing.\nPanel 15 Boom de yada, Boom de yada (Two people sword-fighting on rolling office chairs.)\nA reference to comic 303: Compiling, where two coders battle with fake swords at work, with the excuse that their code is compiling.\nPanel 16 Boom de yada, Boom de yada (Classroom with two students and a teacher.)\nNothing too special, but it does embrace the \"everybody joins in\" theme behind the commercials. The teacher is Miss Lenhart who was first properly introduced in comic 263: Certainty but may have made an appearance in comic 59: Graduation.\nPanel 17 I love elections (Barack me Obamadeus!)\nA pun on the song Rock Me Amadeus and US president Barack Obama. At this point Randall had not done any comics directly on elections but he made this after the one in 2008: 500: Election and has shown his love for this subject also around the 2012 election.\nPanel 18 I love transistors.\nThis panel has Cueball's crotch replaced with the (similar-looking) icon used for a transistor in a circuit diagram. Randall later showed how much he loves anything that can go in to such a diagram in 730: Circuit Diagram.\nPanel 19 I love weird pillow talk. (There must be Taft slash fiction.)\n\"Pillow talk\" means intimate conversations between lovers, \"slash fiction\" is fanfiction with characters of the same sex, and \"Taft\" is William Howard Taft, a US President mostly remembered for his severe obesity. It appears they are invoking rule 34 of the Internet as a reference to 305: Rule 34. Weird pillow talk is also the subject of comic 69: Pillow Talk, while the Taft reference comes from comic 214: The Problem with Wikipedia.\nPanel 20 I love your sister.\nA reference to xkcd's recurring joke of dating the female character's sister, which spans several comics including 49: Want, 279: Pickup Lines, 317: That Lovin' Feelin', and 408: Overqualified.\nPanel 21 I love the whole world (Roller coaster with Cueball holding chess board)\nA reference to comic 249: Chess Photo which inspired an internet meme.\nPanel 22 The future's pretty cool! (Beret Guy in a forest.)\nThe picture of the forest is similar to that in 269: TCMP, though it may also be a reference to comic 167: Nihilism, where Cueball and Beret Guy make observations about the future while climbing a tree. Later, in comic 1322: Winter, the two are seen walking through a forest very similar to the one shown here.\nPanel 23 Boom de yada, Boom de yada (Megan doing the MC Hammer slide towards Cueball.)\nA reference to comic 108: M.C. Hammer Slide, where Hairy falls in love with \"a girl whose only mode of transportation is the M.C. Hammer Slide.\"\nPanel 24 Boom de yada, Boom de yada (Cueball and Megan on an electric skateboard.)\nA reference to comic 409: Electric Skateboard (Double Comic), where Megan and Cueball go on an electric skateboard ride, but he already introduced these back in 139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards."

If you had looked it up, you would have discovered that \u2018octopi\u2019 is not the preferred spelling. It is not a spelling at all. The word does not exist, except in the mouths of those who are pretending to be educated but in fact are not. This is because the \u2018us\u2019 ending of \u2018octopus\u2019 is not a Latin nominative singular ending, which would form its plural by changing to the letter \u2018i\u2019. Instead, the syllable \u2018pus\u2019 in \u2018octopus\u2019 is the Greek word for \u2018foot.\u2019 And it forms its plural the Greek way. Therefore \u2018octopoda\u2019, not \u2018octopi\u2019. Never \u2018octopi\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then, octopoda. Your son\u2019s paper said octopuses.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Step. \u201cWhen he asked me the correct plural, I told him octopoda. But then he was still uncertain, because my son doesn\u2019t think he knows something until he knows it, and so he looked it up. And to my surprise, octopoda is only used when referring to more than one species of octopus, rather than when referring to more than one actual octopus.

        "transcript": "Thing to be approximated: Formula proposed: Resulting approximate value: Correct value: Discussion:\nOne light-year(m) 998 9,227,446,944,279,201 9,460,730,472,580,800 (exact) Based on 365.25 days per year (see below). 998 and 698 are sexual references.\nEarth Surface(m2) 698 513,798,374,428,641 5.10072*1014 998 and 698 are sexual references.\nOceans' volume(m3) 919 1,350,851,717,672,992,089 1,332*1018\nSeconds in a year 754 31,640,625 31,557,600 (Julian calendar), 31,556,952 (Gregorian calendar) After this comic was released Randall got many responses by viewers. So he did add this statement to the top of the comic page:\n\"Lots of emails mention the physicist favorite, 1 year = pi x 107 seconds. 754 is a hair more accurate, but it's hard to top 3,141,592's elegance.\" Pi x 107 is nearly equal to 31,415,926.536, and 754 is exactly 31,640,625. Randall's elegance belongs to the number pi, but it should be multiplied by the factor of ten.\n\nUsing the traditional definitions that a second is 1/60th of a minute, a minute is 1/60th of an hour, and an hour is 1/24th of a day, a 365-day common year is exactly 31,536,000 seconds (the \"for Rent method\" approximation) and the 366-day leap year is 31,622,400 seconds. Until the calendar was reformed by Pope Gregory, there was one leap year in every four years, making the average year 365.25 days, or 31,557,600 seconds. On the current calendar system, there are only 97 leap years in every 400 years, making the average year 365.2425 days, or 31,556,952 seconds. In technical usage, a \"second\" is now defined based on physical constants, even though the length of a day varies inversely with the changing angular velocity of the earth. To keep the official time synchronized with the rotation of the earth, a \"leap second\" is occasionally added, resulting in a slightly longer year.\nSeconds in a year (Rent method) 525,600 x 60 31,536,000 31,557,600 (Julian calendar), 31,556,952 (Gregorian calendar) \"Rent Method\" refers to the song \"Seasons of Love\" from the musical \"Rent.\" The song asks, \"How do you measure a year?\" One line says \"525,600 minutes\" while most of the rest of the song suggests the best way to measure a year is moments shared with a loved one.\nAge of the universe (seconds) 1515 437,893,890,380,859,375 4.354\u00b10.012*1017 (best estimate; exact value unknown)\nPlanck's constant 1/(30\u03c0e) 6.68499014108082*10\u221234 (rounded) 6.62606957*10\u221234 Informally, the Planck constant is the smallest action possible in quantum mechanics.\nFine structure constant 1/140 0.00714285 0.0072973525664 (accepted value as of 2014), close to 1/137 The fine structure constant indicates the strength of electromagnetism. It is unitless and around 0.007297, close to 1/137. At one point it was believed to be exactly the reciprocal of 137, and many people have tried to find a simple formula explaining this (with a pinch of numerology thrown in at times), including the infamous Sir Arthur Adding-One.\nFundamental charge 3/(14 * \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0) 1.59895121062716*10\u221219 (rounded) 1.602176565*10\u221219 (rounded) This is the charge of the proton, symbolized \"e\" for electron (whose charge is actually -e.

It is defined by standard as 9.80665 m/s2, which is exactly 35.30394 (km/h)/s (about 32.174 ft/s2, or 21.937 mph/s). This value was established by the 3rd CGPM (1901, CR 70) and used to define the standard weight of an object as the product of its mass and this nominal acceleration. The acceleration of a body near the surface of the Earth is due to the combined effects of gravity and centrifugal acceleration from rotation of the Earth (but which is small enough to be neglected for most purposes); the total (the apparent gravity) is about 0.5 percent greater at the poles than at the equator.\n\nRandall used a letter g without a suffix, which can also mean the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies depending on one's position on Earth.\nProton-electron mass ratio (e8 - 10) / \u03d5 1836.1530151398 (rounded) 1836.15267246 (rounded) \u03d5 is the golden ratio, or (1 + \u221a5)/2.

Randall's value lies within the actual variation of Earth's radius.

The US remains the only industrialized country that has not adopted the metric system as its official system of measurement. The unit degree Celsius or \u00b0C is an accepted derived unit from the International System of Units (SI units) used in science (which again is the modern form of the metric system). The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin, but this temperature scale is linearly related to the Celsius scale, which is why Celsius can be derived from it.\nThe Fahrenheit scale is from the US Customary system and the (British) Imperial system. The unit is degree Fahrenheit or \u00b0F, and the relation to the Celsius scale is not easy to find in a mental calculation. The relations are: [\u00b0F] = [\u00b0C]\u00d79\u20445 + 32 or [\u00b0C] = ([\u00b0F] \u2212 32)\u00d75\u20449. (For this exact reason Randall has previously made a helpful table for these situations in 526: Converting to Metric)."
